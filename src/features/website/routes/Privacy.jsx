                At Nuaris, we understand the importance of protecting your
                personal information and are committed to its privacy. This
                Privacy Policy explains how Nuaris ("Nuaris," “The Platform,”
                "we," or "us") collects, uses, and shares your data. By using
                the Nuaris Platform, Apps, or visiting our website, you agree to
                the practices described in this policy. This policy is part of

              <p>
                This policy describes the types of personal data we collect,
                including when you use our website, app, products, support
                services, and communications with you through our website,
                phone, email, or live chat (collectively, the "Services").
                "Personal Data" refers to any information that identifies an
                individual, such as name, date of birth, email address, postal
                address, and payment information
              </p>
              <p>
                By providing your Personal Data to us, you consent to its
                processing and sharing in the manner and for the purposes
                described in this policy. If you do not want us to collect or
                process your Personal Data, please do not provide it, though
                this may limit your ability to use some features of our Services

              <h2>Security</h2>
              <p>
                We use industry-standard security measures to protect your
                Personal Data. For example, all credit card information is
                encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However,
                no transmission method over the internet is 100% secure.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security
